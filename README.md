## Installation <a name="installation"></a>

There should be no necessary libraries to run the code here beyond the Anaconda distribution of Python.  The code should run with no issues using Python versions 3.*.

## Project Motivation<a name="motivation"></a>

For this project, I was interestested in using Stack Overflow data from 2017 to better understand:

1. Is there correlation between the education of responders (developers, analysts) and the level of education of their parents?
2. Do people who choose a technical career path (developers, anlysts) have certain personal traits or preferences in common?
3. Based on person's characteristics, is it possible to predict if they enjoyed the survey?

## File Descriptions <a name="files"></a>

There is one notebook available with analysis of the dataset with regard to the 3 questions above. The notebook is self-explanatory, it contains explanations and comments. 

## Results<a name="results"></a>

The main findings of the code can be found at the post available [here](https://medium.com/@alicja.roelofsen/what-makes-a-developer-f1d8f82ebc19).

## Licensing, Authors, Acknowledgements<a name="licensing"></a>

I would like to give credit to Stack Overflow for the data.  Licence: Database: Open Database, Contents: Database Contents.
